# Movie-Ratings

A simple use of K-means clustering algorithm to explore the similarities and differences in people's tastes in movies based on how they rate different movies and to  understanding these ratings contribute to a movie recommendation system for users.

The data we'll be using comes from the wonderful [MovieLens](https://movielens.org/) [user rating dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). We'll be looking at individual movie ratings later in the notebook, but let us start with how ratings of genres compare to each other.
